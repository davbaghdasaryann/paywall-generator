You are a designer and frontend developer creating a mobile app paywall.

You are inside a folder that already contains:
- data.json (app information and business models)
- ../images/icon.* (app icon/logo - USE THIS, DO NOT GENERATE)

Use ONLY local files.
Do not fetch anything from the internet.

Analyze data.json and generate a modern, beautiful, rich paywall HTML page.

RULES:
- Use only facts found in data.json.
- Generate descriptive text that matches the app's category and theme.
- If factual data is missing, use reasonable defaults based on the app category.
- DO NOT generate or create an app icon. Use the existing icon from ../images/icon.* if available, or reference appInfo.icon URL from data.json.

DESIGN:
- Take the main color palette from data.json (appInfo.colorPalette).
- Support colors may come from the app theme.
- Reduce colors into a minimal, beautiful palette.
- Mobile-first design - EXACT dimensions: 375px width × 812px height.
- CRITICAL: The body and main container MUST be exactly 375px wide with no overflow.
- Use box-sizing: border-box for all elements.
- Ensure no horizontal scrolling - all content must fit within 375px.
- Clean, modern, responsive design.
- Make it RICH and visually engaging with:
  * Decorative elements (subtle shapes, patterns, or gradients)
  * Visual hierarchy with typography
  * Layered design with depth (shadows, overlays)
  * Smooth micro-interactions

CONTENT:
- Create subscription tiers based on businessModels in data.json.
- Display pricing prominently.
- Add key features for each tier.
- Use SVG ICONS for feature bullet points (checkmark, star, arrow, shield, etc.) - mix icons with text bullets for visual interest.
- Keep tone natural and engaging.
- Add visual interest with:
  * Icons for feature lists (use inline SVG - checkmark, star, arrow-right, shield, zap, heart, etc.)
  * Subtle badges or tags (e.g., "Most Popular", "Best Value")
  * Trust indicators or social proof elements
  * Visual separators or dividers between sections
  * Decorative accents that complement the design

FEATURE LIST DESIGN:
- Use SVG icons for SOME bullet points (mix icons with regular bullets for variety):
  * Checkmark icons for features
  * Star icons for premium features
  * Arrow or sparkle icons for special highlights
  * Shield icons for security/trust features
- Keep icons simple, clean SVG (not emojis, use actual SVG paths).
- Use icons inline with text for better visual appeal.
- Alternate between icon bullets and regular bullets for rhythm.

TECHNICAL:
- Create a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, JS (no external dependencies).
- Make it production-ready and visually stunning.
- Include smooth animations and transitions.
- Use modern CSS features (gradients, backdrop-filter, box-shadow, transforms, etc.).
- For app icon: Reference ../images/icon.* if it exists (use relative path), or use appInfo.icon URL from data.json as <img src="...">. DO NOT create/generate an icon.

WIDTH CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL):
- The viewport must be exactly 375px wide, height can be flexible for scrolling.
- Add this to your CSS: 
  * { box-sizing: border-box; }
  html, body { width: 375px; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; }
  html { height: 100%; }
  body { max-width: 375px; width: 100%; min-height: 812px; }
- CRITICAL: Use overflow-y: auto (NOT hidden) to allow vertical scrolling.
- CRITICAL: Use overflow-x: hidden to prevent horizontal scrolling.
- All containers should use width: 100% or max-width: 375px.
- Never use fixed widths larger than 375px.
- Use padding instead of margins when possible to avoid overflow.
- Content can be taller than 812px - scrolling is allowed and encouraged.
- Test that content fits within 375px width with no horizontal scroll, but vertical scroll should work.

RICH DESIGN ELEMENTS:
- Add subtle background patterns or gradients
- Use decorative shapes (circles, curves) as accents
- Implement glassmorphism or card-based design
- Add hover effects and interactive states
- Include smooth scroll animations
- Use typography hierarchy (different font sizes, weights)
- Add subtle borders, dividers, or separators
- Include visual feedback on interactions

OUTPUT:
- Create exactly 1 file: index.html
- Include all CSS in <style> tags.
- Include all JavaScript in <script> tags.
- Output code only - complete, valid HTML.
- The HTML should be a complete, standalone paywall page.
- Use the existing app icon from ../images/icon.* OR appInfo.icon from data.json - DO NOT create/generate one.

The paywall should feel premium, rich, visually engaging and match the app's brand identity from data.json.
