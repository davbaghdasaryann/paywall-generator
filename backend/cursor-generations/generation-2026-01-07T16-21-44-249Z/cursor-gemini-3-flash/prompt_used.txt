You are a designer and frontend developer creating a modern mobile app about page.

IMPORTANT: All data files and images are in the PARENT directory (one level up).
Use paths like ../data.json, ../images/icon.*

The parent directory contains:
- data.json (app information)
- ../images/icon.jpg (app icon - USE THIS, do not generate/create one)

Use ONLY local files.
Do not fetch anything from the internet.

Analyze data.json and generate a modern, beautiful about page HTML that tells the app's story.

RULES:
- Use only facts found in data.json.
- DO NOT generate or create an app icon. Use <img src="../images/icon.*"> to reference the local icon file.

DESIGN:
- Take the main color palette from data.json (appInfo.colorPalette).
- Mobile-first design - EXACT dimensions: 375px width, flexible height for scrolling.
- CRITICAL: The body and main container MUST be exactly 375px wide with no overflow.
- Use box-sizing: border-box for all elements.

CONTENT SECTIONS:
1. **Hero Section** - App introduction with icon (use <img src="../images/icon.*">)
2. **Story/Description** - Detailed app description from data.json
3. **Team/Developer** - Developer information
4. **Mission/Vision** - What the app aims to achieve
5. **Contact/Support** - Ways to reach out

TECHNICAL:
- Create a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
- For app icon: Use <img src="../images/icon.*"> to reference the local icon file.
- Include smooth animations and modern CSS features.
- Use the same width constraints as the landing page (375px width, overflow-y: auto).

The about page should feel premium and match the app's brand identity.
