You are a designer and frontend developer creating a modern mobile app landing page.

You are inside a folder that already contains:
- data.json (app information)
- ../images/icon.* (app icon/logo - USE THIS, DO NOT GENERATE)

Use ONLY local files.
Do not fetch anything from the internet.

Analyze data.json and generate a modern, beautiful, single-page landing page HTML.

RULES:
- Use only facts found in data.json.
- Generate descriptive, engaging content that matches the app's category and theme.
- Create compelling copy that highlights the app's value proposition.
- DO NOT generate or create an app icon. Use the existing icon from ../images/icon.* if available, or reference appInfo.icon URL from data.json.

DESIGN:
- Take the main color palette from data.json (appInfo.colorPalette).
- Support colors may come from the app theme.
- Mobile-first design - EXACT dimensions: 375px width, flexible height for scrolling.
- CRITICAL: The body and main container MUST be exactly 375px wide with no overflow.
- Use box-sizing: border-box for all elements.
- Ensure no horizontal scrolling - all content must fit within 375px.
- Clean, modern, responsive design.
- Make it RICH and visually engaging with:
  * Hero section with app icon and headline
  * Feature highlights section
  * Benefits/social proof section
  * Call-to-action section
  * Decorative elements and smooth animations

CONTENT SECTIONS:
1. **Hero Section** - Eye-catching header with:
   - App icon/logo (use existing from ../images/icon.*)
   - App name and tagline
   - Main value proposition
   - Primary call-to-action button

2. **Features Section** - Highlight key features:
   - 3-5 main features with icons
   - Brief descriptions
   - Visual icons (SVG, not emojis)

3. **Benefits/Why Choose Section** - Show value:
   - Key benefits or unique selling points
   - Visual elements that support the message

4. **Social Proof/Testimonials** - Build trust:
   - Star ratings or testimonials
   - User count or download numbers (if available)

5. **Final CTA Section** - Strong call-to-action:
   - Download button
   - App Store / Play Store badges

TECHNICAL:
- Create a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, JS (no external dependencies).
- Make it production-ready and visually stunning.
- Include smooth animations and scroll effects.
- Use modern CSS features (gradients, backdrop-filter, box-shadow, transforms, etc.).
- For app icon: Use <img src="../images/icon.*"> to reference the local icon file. If the path doesn't work, the system will automatically replace it with the original URL.
- For screenshots: Use <img src="../images/screenshot1.*">, etc. The system will automatically fix these paths.

WIDTH CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL):
- The viewport must be exactly 375px wide, height can be flexible for scrolling.
- Add this to your CSS: 
  * { box-sizing: border-box; }
  html, body { width: 375px; margin: 0; padding: 0; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; }
  html { height: 100%; }
  body { max-width: 375px; width: 100%; min-height: 812px; }
- CRITICAL: Use overflow-y: auto (NOT hidden) to allow vertical scrolling.
- Content can be taller than 812px - scrolling is allowed and encouraged.

The landing page should feel premium, modern, and compelling, showcasing the app's value and encouraging downloads.
