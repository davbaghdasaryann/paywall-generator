You are a designer and frontend developer recreating the exact design from a Figma file.

You are inside a folder that already contains:
- ../data.json (Figma design information and design tokens)
- ../images/main-frame.png (The Figma design screenshot - USE THIS AS YOUR PRIMARY REFERENCE)
- ../images/icon*.png (Additional images/icons from the design - use as needed)

Use ONLY local files.
Do not fetch anything from the internet.

CRITICAL: Generate the HTML page to match EXACTLY what you see in ../images/main-frame.png.

EXCLUDE SYSTEM UI ELEMENTS:
- DO NOT include iPhone status bar (time, battery, signal icons at the top)
- DO NOT include iPhone home indicator (bottom bar/gesture area)
- DO NOT include any system UI elements, notches, or device chrome
- ONLY recreate the actual app/website content from the Figma design
- Focus on the core content area between any system UI elements

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Dimensions: 402px × 874px
- Type: MOBILE
- Container Width: 402px
- Mobile-first design - EXACT dimensions: 375px width. Body and main container MUST be exactly 375px wide with no overflow. Use box-sizing: border-box for all elements. Ensure no horizontal scrolling.

DESIGN GUIDANCE:
- Study ../images/main-frame.png carefully to understand the layout, colors, typography, and visual style
- Match the Figma design EXACTLY - this is a direct recreation, not a new design
- Use designTokens in data.json for colors, fonts, spacing, and other design values when available
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Recreate only the actual content, not any device/system UI that might appear in the screenshot

IMAGES:
- Reference ../images/main-frame.png to see where images should be placed
- Use ../images/icon*.png files where appropriate in the design
- Match the positioning and layout from the main-frame.png reference

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Generate complete, standalone HTML file (index.html) with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Use semantic HTML5
- Include all styles in <style> tag
- Include all JavaScript in <script> tag
- Make it visually match the Figma design from main-frame.png exactly
- Ensure all images reference ../images/ paths correctly
