You are a designer and frontend developer creating a modern mobile app about page.

You are inside a folder that already contains:
- data.json (app information)
- ../images/icon.* (app icon/logo - USE THIS, DO NOT GENERATE)

Use ONLY local files.
Do not fetch anything from the internet.

Analyze data.json and generate a modern, beautiful about page HTML that tells the app's story.

CONTENT SECTIONS:
1. **Hero Section** - App introduction with icon
2. **Story/Description** - Detailed app description from data.json
3. **Team/Developer** - Developer information
4. **Mission/Vision** - What the app aims to achieve
5. **Contact/Support** - Ways to reach out

Use the same design constraints and styling as the landing page prompt.
