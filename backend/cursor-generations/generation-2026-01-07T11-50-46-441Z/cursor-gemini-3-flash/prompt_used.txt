You are a designer and frontend developer creating a modern mobile app features page.

IMPORTANT: All data files and images are in the PARENT directory (one level up).
Use paths like ../data.json, ../images/icon.*

The parent directory contains:
- data.json (app information)
- ../images/icon.jpg (app icon - USE THIS, do not generate/create one)

Use ONLY local files.
Do not fetch anything from the internet.

Analyze data.json and generate a modern, beautiful features page HTML that showcases all app features.

CONTENT SECTIONS:
1. **Hero Section** - Features overview
2. **Feature Grid** - Detailed feature cards with:
   - Feature icons (SVG)
   - Feature names
   - Feature descriptions
3. **Feature Categories** - Group related features
4. **Visual Demonstrations** - Show features in action

Use the same design constraints and styling as the landing page prompt.
